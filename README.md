## 1. Get the hardware

We have compiled a list of off-the-shelf components that you can use to build your own Robocar quickly. All components are supported out of the box and can be obtained from a variety of providers.

## 2. Download the code

For now, you need to download and compile the code yourself (it's just a regular Android Studio project!). In the future, we might be able provide prebuilt APKs.

## 3. Join the community

Robocars are more fun with friends. Whether you have a fully functional Robocar, or you're just starting, join your local meetup.
