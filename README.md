# Android Robocar

Little autonomous cars built with [Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things).

## 1. Get the hardware

We have compiled [a list of off-the-shelf components](https://www.github.com/zugaldia/android-robocar/wiki/Hardware) so that you can build your own Robocar quickly. All the components in the list are supported by this project and can be obtained from a variety of providers.

## 2. Download the app

While you can download and compile the code yourself (it's just a regular Android Studio project!), you can simply [download the latest APK](https://30-83142122-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/tmp/circle-artifacts.tuAh78n/apk/robocar-0.1-SNAPSHOT-debug.apk) and install it on your car.

## 3. Join the community

Robocars are more fun with friends. Whether you have a fully functional Robocar, or you're just starting, join your local meetup:

- [Washington, DC](https://www.meetup.com/DIYRobocarsDC)
- [Oakland, CA](https://www.meetup.com/DIYRobocars)
- Visit [DIY Robocars](https://www.diyrobocars.com) for more locations.

## FAQ

### I want to be able to control my Robocar manually, with a regular controller, can I do that?

Yes, we support for example the NES30 game controller, and most Bluetooth controllers will work too.

### How does it work? Does it use Computer Vision, or does it have some kind of AI?

Both. The code shows how to use OpenCV to do lane detection with computer vision, and TensorFlow to implement a deep neural network that you can use to train the Robocar to drive itself.

### What's the catch? What're you really trying to sell me here?

There's no catch, all the software is open source built on top of off-the-shelf components that anyone can buy. We built this project because we wanted to learn how autonomous cars work, and make it easier for others to learn too. And because it's real fun.

### Do you accept bug reports, code contributions, etc?

We like code contributions more than bug reports but we accept both :)

### I saw you present recently, where can I get the slides?
