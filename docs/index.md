## Frequently Asked Questions

### I want to be able to drive my Robocar manually, with a regular controller, can I do that?

Yes, we support for example the NES30 game controller, and most Bluetooth controllers will work too.

### How does it work? Does it use Computer Vision, or does it have some kind of AI?

Both. The code shows how to use OpenCV to do lane detection with computer vision, and TensorFlow to implement a deep neural network that you can use to train the Robocar to drive itself.

### What's the catch? What're you really trying to sell me here?

There's no catch, all the software is open source built on top of off-the-shelf components that anyone can buy. We built this project because we wanted to learn how autonomous cars work, and make it easier for others to learn too. And because it's real fun.

### Do you accept bug reports, code contributions, etc?

We like code contributions more than bug reports but we accept both :)

### I saw you present recently, where can I get the slides?

Check our [events page](pages/events) for upcoming dates and slides.
